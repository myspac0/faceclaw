/**
 * The Glanceboard's visibility rules, as a pure reducer so they can be tested
 * without the display plumbing. The board is an alternate sleep-time display:
 * while the shell is asleep a press (single tap, or a head-tilt wake) shows it
 * for a short while, a hold (long-press or short-then-long-press) shows it until release,
 * and a double-tap dismisses it in favour of the regular UI. GlanceHost feeds
 * these events in and applies the resulting visibility to the compositor.
 *
 * No NativeScript imports: this module is compiled and run under plain node
 * by tests/glance-state.test.cjs.
