/**
 * Arbitrates the glasses' magnetometer compass (CFW mode-10 stream) among
 * running EvenHub apps, mirroring the IMU router. Only the foreground app
 * receives headings, so a backgrounded app can't keep the sensor running.
 *
 * The raw reading is NOT pre-calibrated — the magnetometer is in the right
 * arm, which rests on the head with a wearer-dependent curl (see compass-app
 * memory). Each delivery also carries the Compass app's wearer-calibrated
 * magnetic heading and, when the phone has a location, declination and the
 * true heading, so apps needn't redo that work.
